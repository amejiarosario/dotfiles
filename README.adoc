= Dotfiles

Inspired on 
- https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Cheatsheet
- https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles 
- https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

I prefered a fast terminal to a pretty one. 
Before I had `oh-my-zsh` and many plugins that make load time very slow.
No this time. :)
